# Security-system-using-smart-card-technology

This project is designed to gain access to an area by using a valid smart card only. The security of any organization is the top most priority for the concerned authorities. Much efforts and money are being put into making any organization secure from any unwanted dangerous elements. While providing access using password is one way but the method is tiring and time consuming. With such huge advancements in technology, smart cards provide an effective and efficient way to ensure the security of any organisation. Using this technology, only the authorised person with a valid smart card will be allowed access into the organisation. The project makes the use of an RFID module. RFID technology can track movement of objects through a network of radio-enabled scanning devices over a distance of several metres. A device called RFID tag, or simply a tag, is a key component of the technology. Authorised people are provided with these unique tags, using which they can access a particular area. The RFID scanner is interfaced to Node MCU. The project also involves the implementation of Internet of Things or IOT so as to provide an entire database of when a person leaves or enters. This database can then be displayed on a site using IOT. This enhances the level of security of an organisation by providing an option to check the database in case of any mis happenings in the organisation.
